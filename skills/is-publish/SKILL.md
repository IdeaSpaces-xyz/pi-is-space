  my other computer, or make it available to the team; or after `/is-setup`

# Publish an Ideaspace

**Goal:** login check → plan (`publish` without `--yes`, zero mutations) → the user agrees →
apply (`publish --yes`) → narrate result. The plan-then-apply split is the CLI's contract, not a
courtesy — the outward tier of the agreement principle.

**Pi command available:** for human-triggered publishing, prefer `/is-publish`. It checks scaffold/branch state, confirms destination, runs the same CLI publish command, and offers login/retry if the CLI reports missing credentials. Use this skill when the agent needs the protocol, when `/is-publish` is unavailable, or for recovery reasoning after a failed publish.

This skill is the conversational layer around the IdeaSpaces CLI. The extension exposes the resolved CLI as `$IS_CLI_PATH` when available. Define this helper in any `bash` command that invokes the CLI:

```bash
is_cli() {
  if [ -n "$IS_CLI_PATH" ] && [ -f "$IS_CLI_PATH" ]; then
    case "$IS_CLI_PATH" in
      *.js) node "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;   # dev: a .js bundle needs node
      *) "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;           # a compiled sidecar runs directly
    esac
  else
    ideaspaces "$@"
  fi
}
```

No separate install required.

## 1. Pre-flight checks

**Inside an ideaspace?** This dir should be a git repo with `_agent/foundation.md` already scaffolded. If not, suggest `/is-setup` first.

```bash
test -f _agent/foundation.md && test -d .git && echo "ok" || echo "missing"
```

**Portable identity agrees?** Current shared scaffolds declare `root_node_id`; legacy Spaces may validly omit it. Never mint, edit, stage, or commit identity during publish. Run `is_cli status --json` and inspect `root_identity`: stop on `invalid`, `drift`, `ambiguous`, or `declaration.dirty`. The CLI repeats this preflight against HEAD, index, worktree, canonical origin, and local registry before login or remote mutation.

**Markdown frontmatter parses?** `ideaspaces publish` preflights all tracked Markdown for YAML syntax. If it fails, surface the CLI output and ask the user to fix and commit the reported YAML.

**On the `main` branch?** IdeaSpaces uses `main` as the default branch — publishing requires the local branch to match so server and clones stay aligned. Detect:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If output is the literal string `HEAD`, the user is in detached-HEAD state. Don't offer a rename — short-circuit with: *"You're in detached-HEAD state. Check out a branch first (e.g. `git checkout main`) and re-run `/is-publish`."*

Otherwise, if output isn't `main`, ask before proceeding:

> "You're on `<current-branch>`. IdeaSpaces uses `main` as the default — keeping local and remote consistent makes future `git pull` / clones work without surprises. Rename `<current-branch>` → `main` for this folder?"

In a non-interactive session there is nobody to answer — never rename on your own; stop with the question as the result. If yes, run `git branch -m main`. If the rename fails (most common cause: a local `main` branch already exists — perhaps stale or orphaned), surface git's error verbatim and stop with: *"You may already have a local `main` branch. Resolve manually (`git branch -d main` if it's stale, or `git checkout main` if it's the one you want) and re-run `/is-publish`."* On success, continue. If the user declines the rename, abort: *"Switch to `main` and re-run `/is-publish` when ready."* — don't try to push a non-main branch; `ideaspaces publish` refuses anyway.

**Logged in?** Check the credentials file directly — its presence is the login signal:

```bash
test -f ~/.ideaspaces/credentials.json && echo "yes" || echo "no"
```

If `no`, propose login. If `yes`, continue.

**Already published?** Check the folder-keyed map, if present:

```bash
node - <<'NODE'
const fs = require('fs');
const path = `${process.env.HOME}/.ideaspaces/spaces.json`;
if (!fs.existsSync(path)) { console.log('null'); process.exit(0); }
const map = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8'));
console.log(JSON.stringify(map[process.cwd()] || null));
NODE
```

If non-null, this folder is already mapped to a remote. Re-publishing is fine — the CLI reuses the existing `repo_id` and pushes to the same remote.

## 2. Login if needed

> "You'll need to log in first — that's how IdeaSpaces knows the space belongs to you. I'll open a browser; complete the OAuth flow there and credentials save locally. OK?"

On confirm:

```bash
is_cli login
```

If the user is in a remote shell or browser open fails, surface the CLI output and let them decide the next step.

## 3. Plan — run publish without `--yes`

The CLI is plan-first: without `--yes` it runs every preflight, prints exactly what would happen —
destination `namespace/slug`, the dir-local git identity write, whether the tip-commit author gets
rewritten, the origin URL, the commit count — and **changes nothing**, local or remote.

```bash
is_cli publish [--slug ...] [--name ...] [--hostname ...]
```

Show the user the plan and get their yes. Publishing is an outward action: even when the user
already said "publish this", the plan surfaces side effects they haven't seen — one look before it
happens is the agreement, not friction. Flag overrides: `--slug <name>`, `--name "<display>"`,
`--hostname <host>` for org spaces (first publish only). For re-publish the plan says it reuses
the existing Space identity — don't re-ask names.

**Non-interactive sessions stop here.** With nobody to agree, the plan output *is* the honest
result; never add `--yes` on the user's behalf.

## 4. Apply — run with `--yes`

On the user's yes:

```bash
is_cli publish --yes [same flags as the plan]
```

The CLI:

1. Evaluates the committed foundation against index/worktree, canonical origin, and local registry evidence.
2. Preflights tracked Markdown syntax and size before network work.
3. Confirms login and asks Keeper to adopt the exact committed `root_node_id` on first publish.
4. Creates or reuses the one matching hosted Space; `--force` cannot fork or rekey it.
5. Sets repo-local Git attribution, configures the matching canonical origin, and pushes `main`.
6. Records the verified folder ↔ Space binding in `~/.ideaspaces/spaces.json`.

### Size-cap recovery (oversized tracked files)

If the CLI exits 1 with `Cannot publish yet: N tracked file(s) exceed the 200,000-byte server limit.` followed by a list of `path (bytes)` lines, the offenders are tracked files larger than the server cap. The CLI fails fast locally — no push attempted. Parse the offender list and decide:

**Known clutter** — if every offender path matches one of these patterns, offer the conversational fix as a single yes/no:

```
.obsidian/    node_modules/    .DS_Store    .cache/    .idea/    .vscode/
```

> *"I see `<matched paths>` tracked — that's <vault config / build output / editor metadata>, not your knowledge. I can append <patterns> to `.gitignore`, untrack with `git rm --cached -r <path>`, commit, and retry publish. OK?"*

Before changing anything, require a clean index with `git diff --cached --quiet`. If it is not clean, stop and ask the user to commit or unstage their existing work first — never mix publish cleanup with an in-progress commit. Also require `git status --short -- .gitignore` to be empty before appending. If it is not empty, stop and surface the pre-existing modified or untracked file instead of absorbing it into the cleanup commit.

On confirm, run in this order:

1. Append the matching patterns to `.gitignore` without duplicating existing lines, then stage only that file with `git add -- .gitignore` if it changed.
2. Run `git rm --cached -r -- <path>` for each confirmed clutter path. This removes it from git while preserving the local files.
3. Review `git diff --cached --name-status`. Every staged entry must be `.gitignore` or a removal under the confirmed clutter paths. If anything else is staged, stop — do not commit or publish.
4. Only with that exact staged set, run `git commit -m "Untrack non-publishable clutter"`. The clean-index gate and staged-set check are mandatory because this commit intentionally records the prepared index; skipping either could sweep unrelated work.
5. Re-run `is_cli publish` with the previously confirmed arguments.

If any step fails, leave the state visible with `git status --short` and stop for the user to review.

**Mixed or unknown offenders** — if any offender is outside the clutter list (e.g. a 5 MB image the user might want), don't auto-fix. Surface the CLI output verbatim and stop with: *"These files are over the 200KB cap. Shrink them, store externally, or link via frontmatter (`attached_to:`). Re-run `/is-publish` when resolved."* — the user might have intent for that file.

## 5. Narrate result

On success, surface the remote URL and the local changes:

> "Published `<name>` to `<remote_url>`. This folder's git identity is now `person:<username>@ideaspaces` locally, so server-side attribution works. The folder mapping is saved at `~/.ideaspaces/spaces.json`."

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to suggest |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot publish yet: markdown frontmatter is invalid.` | Malformed YAML frontmatter | Fix the reported YAML syntax, commit the repair, and re-run publish. |
| `Not logged in` | No stored credentials | Run `ideaspaces login`. |
| `Cannot publish yet: N tracked file(s) exceed the 200,000-byte server limit.` | CLI size preflight | See "Size-cap recovery" above — auto-handle known clutter, surface the rest. |
| `Push failed: ... size cap` | Server-side cap (only if CLI preflight is bypassed) | Same as above; re-run `/is-publish` so the local preflight surfaces the offender list. |
| `Push failed: ... attribution doesn't match` | Commit author doesn't match account | Re-run publish; it sets local `user.email`. Amend/recommit if needed. |
| `Local branch is \`<x>\`; IdeaSpaces uses \`main\`` | Pre-flight didn't run / user invoked CLI directly | Rename via `git branch -m main` and retry, or use `/is-publish` which offers the rename. |
| `Couldn't determine the current branch — is HEAD detached?` | Detached-HEAD state (rare; pre-flight catches via skill) | Check out a branch (`git checkout main`) and retry. |
| `Root identity evidence is invalid` / `Root identity drift` / `Root identity is ambiguous` | Foundation, origin, or registry evidence is unsafe | Stop. Inspect `is_cli status --json`; repair evidence explicitly without rewriting identity. |
| `The root identity declaration differs between HEAD, the index, and the worktree` | Identity has an uncommitted change | Commit the intended declaration or restore it; never publish a different worktree value than HEAD. |
| `publish --force cannot fork or rekey` | Existing hosted binding | Re-publish normally, or use the explicit local Fork lifecycle in a separate destination. |
| `--name only apply on first publish` | Re-publish path | Drop the flag. A new name/identity requires an explicit local Fork, not `--force`. |

Recovery posture: re-running publish is safe after repair. Never delete or replace a mapping merely to make publish proceed: restore the matching remote/access, use `ideaspaces link` when the hosted identity is known, or create an explicit local Fork in a separate destination when the user intends a new Space.
