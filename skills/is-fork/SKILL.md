# Fork a Space Locally

Fork brings one copy-authorized Space home as a new independent local Git repository. A public,
copy-enabled source needs no IdeaSpaces account. The result has fresh Note and root identity, one
import commit, source lineage for later updates, no source history, no remote, and no hosted owner.

This is a conversational layer over the IdeaSpaces CLI. The extension exposes the resolved CLI as
`$IS_CLI_PATH` when available. Define this helper in any `bash` command that invokes it:

```bash
is_cli() {
  if [ -n "$IS_CLI_PATH" ] && [ -f "$IS_CLI_PATH" ]; then
    case "$IS_CLI_PATH" in
      *.js) node "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;
      *) "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;
    esac
  else
    ideaspaces "$@"
  fi
}
```

No separate install or native `is_fork` tool is required.

## Confirm the coordinate

Require a canonical Space URL and choose the destination folder. If the user omitted the folder,
state the CLI-derived local name before running. A destination that already exists is never merged,
replaced, or removed. If the user already named both source and destination, that is confirmation;
do not ask twice.

`--name <local-name>` changes only the unpublished display name. Never pass `--location` or `--slug`:
hosting placement belongs to later `ideaspaces publish --hostname/--slug`.

## Materialize

Quote the URL, path, and optional name:

```bash
is_cli fork "<space-url>" "<destination>" [--name "<local-name>"]
```

Do not log in first for a public source. The CLI sends valid ambient credentials when they already
exist, allowing a directly shared private Fork through the same local-only path, but never invents
an empty token. If a private source is neutrally refused and the user expects direct access, offer
`is_auth action="login"`, then retry the identical command.

The CLI validates the complete bounded snapshot before touching the destination and removes its
temporary sibling on failure. Do not reproduce the snapshot with `curl`, raw file writes, or Git
plumbing.

## Report the result

State:

- destination path and fresh local Space identity;
- that source history was not copied;
- that the repository has one clean `main` import commit and no remote;
- that the Space is unpublished and locally owned.

Offer **is-publish** only if the user now wants remote hosting. Publishing is the account boundary;
Fork itself is not.
