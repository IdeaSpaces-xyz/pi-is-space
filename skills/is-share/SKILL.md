description: >
  Manage who can access an ideaspace and whether it is public. Use when the user
  asks to share with a person or team, list or remove recipients, choose
  Explore/Fork/Collaborate, or make a Space public/private. Do not use for
  pushing committed captures to the remote; that is is-push.

# Share Access

Share manages recipients and public visibility. It is not Git push: **is-push** sends committed
state to an existing remote, while this skill changes who may use that remote Space.

This is a conversational layer over the IdeaSpaces CLI. The extension exposes the resolved CLI as
`$IS_CLI_PATH` when available. Define this helper in any `bash` command that invokes it:

```bash
is_cli() {
  if [ -n "$IS_CLI_PATH" ] && [ -f "$IS_CLI_PATH" ]; then
    case "$IS_CLI_PATH" in
      *.js) node "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;
      *) "$IS_CLI_PATH" "$@" ;;
    esac
  else
    ideaspaces "$@"
  fi
}
```

No separate install is required. This release deliberately keeps Share CLI-backed; there is no
native `is_share` tool to discover or emulate with raw platform calls.

## Product choices

Use only these user-facing choices:

- **Explore** — view the shared Content. No independent copy or Git access.
- **Fork** — Explore plus an independent current-version copy. It does not expose source history.
- **Collaborate** — Explore plus clone/fetch/push on the same Space, including source history. Bytes
  already fetched cannot be revoked later.
- **Public** — anyone may View and materialize a local Fork without an account. Publishing that
  independent Space still requires sign-in. Source history, clone, and push remain private.
- **Private** — disable public view and public Fork/Copy without changing named people or team access.

Hosted history for a person is an optional, separately revocable trail; do not describe it as clone
or Collaborate.

## Choose the target

The current published folder is the default. If the user names another Space, pass its canonical URL
with `--space <url>`. Never ask for internal user, organization, Grant, userset, or repository
identifiers.

Before a mutation, state the exact target, recipient or visibility, grade, and history implication.
Ask for confirmation when any of those were inferred or omitted. A current request that already names
the complete operation counts as confirmation; do not ask twice. Listing is read-only and needs no
confirmation.

## Commands

Quote every user-provided recipient, hostname, and URL when invoking Bash.

```bash
# Person: email or @handle
is_cli share person "someone@example.com" --grade explore
is_cli share person "@someone" --grade fork
is_cli share person "someone@example.com" --grade collaborate --history

# Registered team hostname
is_cli share team "acme.com" --grade collaborate

# Combined people, invitations, and teams
is_cli share list

# Aggregate removal by recipient
is_cli share remove "someone@example.com"
is_cli share remove "team:acme.com"

# Public/private choice
is_cli share visibility public
is_cli share visibility private
```

Append `--space "<url>"` when targeting a Space other than the current folder. Use the normal human
output rather than `--json`: report recipients, grades, direct standing, and surviving effective
access, but do not surface backend coordinates.

If authentication is required, offer `is_auth action="login"`, then retry the same command. Do not
fall back to legacy compatibility subcommands unless the user explicitly asks to manage legacy
access.

## Report the result

- Say who or which team changed, at which grade, and whether hosted history was included.
- After removal, preserve the CLI's distinction between removed direct access and access surviving
  through another person, team, owner, or policy path.
- After visibility changes, repeat that named grants are unchanged. For Public, distinguish the
  account-free local `ideaspaces fork <space-url> [dir]` path from authenticated later publication.
- If the CLI refuses because the folder is unpublished or unmapped, offer **is-publish** or ask for a
  canonical Space URL. Surface other refusals without translating them into guessed authority.
