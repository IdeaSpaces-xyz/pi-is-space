# Working in an Ideaspace

An ideaspace is a markdown folder where knowledge accumulates. The Pi extension makes the agent fluent in the conventions: how the tree is shaped, where agent context lives, when to capture.

You have two sets of tools:

- **Native** — `read`, `edit`, `write`, `bash`. Default for navigation, search, and source-code work.
- **`is_*` tools** — frontmatter-aware capture (`is_write`) and sync state (`is_auth`). Use when knowledge needs Layer 1 frontmatter or when you need to know whether sync is wired.

## Start here

**No `_agent/` yet?** Suggest `/is-setup` — it walks the user through the contract scaffold and conversational seeding.

**Returning?** Read `_agent/foundation.md` and `_agent/guide.md` first — they always exist on a scaffolded space. Then `_agent/purpose.md`, `now.md`, `next.md` — these may not exist yet. **Missing files are first-class drift signals**: the contract names them, so absence means direction hasn't been captured. Surface this and propose capturing them in conversation before doing other work.

The SessionStart hook surfaces what's present inline along with each file's summary and any operating skills.

## The five-file `_agent/` contract

Every ideaspace carries an `_agent/` folder at root. Two layers:

**Seed** (always scaffolded by `ideaspaces create` / `/is-setup`):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `foundation.md` | What this place is, baseline behaviors. Lives only at the space root and always loads. |
| `guide.md` | How agent and human work together at this scope, anchored to foundation. |

**Emergent** (captured in conversation when content exists, not as placeholder writes):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `purpose.md` | Why this space exists. The North Star. |
| `now.md` | What's currently active. |
| `next.md` | What's queued. |

The contract is self-bootstrapping — `foundation.md` + `guide.md` name the emergent files, so an agent reading the seed sees the gap and proposes capturing the rest. Real content over placeholder filler.

Read all five at session start when present; surface the gap when not.

`CLAUDE.md` at the space root tells compatible agent harnesses where the contract is. Pi also injects an awareness block from `_agent/` at session start.

Branches (deeper directories) can refine via their own `_agent/` (any of guide / purpose / now / next) without re-declaring foundation. Most branches don't need their own — a `README.md` is enough when the agreement is light.

`.gitignore` is also part of the Agreement — the boundary between what's shared and what stays local. Drafts, scratch, secrets, per-developer context go there. Propose changes; never edit silently.

### Optional: `_agent/skills/`

A space can carry **operating skills** as markdown files in `_agent/skills/`. Each skill describes a procedure the agent should follow when working in this space — for example, `_agent/skills/commit.md` defining a three-tier commit shape. Skills are surfaced at session start (the awareness block lists them by name + summary), with full content loaded on demand when invoked.

Read a skill when the agent reaches for the procedure it describes. Don't preload — the listing is enough orientation; the body matters at the moment of use.

## Two Roles at every position

Every position in the tree holds two kinds of content. The folder convention enforces the split.

| Role | What | Folder convention |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **User content** | Notes — knowledge that accumulates | regular `.md` files |
| **Agent context** | Instructions that shape the agent | `_agent/`, `README.md` |

Within user content, voices can coexist at different branches. Don't mix them in one folder — use a subfolder to mark the shift:

- **Raw personal thinking** — one person's voice, pre-refinement. Own folder (e.g., `slow-thoughts/`, `journal/`).
- **Co-produced from conversation** — human + agent. Own folder or subfolder (e.g., `conversations/`, `captured/`). Every file carries `contributed_by: ["person:...", "agent:..."]` and `origin: "conversation:..."`.
- **Stable concept docs** — refined, canonical. Top-level or `concepts/`.

When capturing from a conversation, check the target folder's voice before writing. If the folder is someone's raw personal thinking, don't write co-produced notes there — create a subfolder. See [is-writing](../is-writing/SKILL.md) for voice guidance and [is-capture](../is-capture/SKILL.md) for when to propose capture.

## `is_write` — create/update with Layer 1 frontmatter

Use for capture. Carries the writing standard. Better than raw filesystem `write` when the file should compound as a Note.

- `is_write path="analysis.md" content="..." name="Analysis" summary="Dense orientation"` — create or replace the Note's frontmatter and body
- Optional fields: `tags`, `attached_to`, `if_match`, `force`, `cwd`

Replace-semantics: callers specify all Layer 1 + 2 fields they want set; existing frontmatter is replaced wholesale and the body is preserved. For local file moves, deletions, and metadata-only edits, use native `bash` (`git mv`, `rm`) and `edit`.

Layer 1 (required): `name`, `summary`.
Layer 2 (optional): `tags`, `attached_to`.

**`cwd` matters when you've `cd`-ed inside `bash`.** A `cd subdir` in a `bash` invocation changes that subprocess's cwd; it doesn't propagate back to Pi's extension process. If you've worked in a subdir during the session and then call `is_write` with a relative `path`, `is_write` resolves it against the Pi session cwd — likely the wrong tree.

Pass `cwd` whenever the agent's intended working directory differs from session start:

```
is_write path="_agent/purpose.md" content="..." name="Purpose" summary="..."
         cwd="/abs/path/to/the/space"
```

Default falls back to the Pi session cwd.

## `is_auth` — sync state

- `is_auth action="login"` — log in (opens browser for OAuth)
- `is_auth action="logout"` — clear credentials

Sync is opt-in. The extension works locally without auth.

To host a space remotely after login, run `/is-publish` or `ideaspaces publish` from inside the space directory. It creates a server-side bare repo, sets the local `user.email` to the OAuth-resolved identity, and pushes. Folder ↔ repo mapping persists at `~/.ideaspaces/spaces.json` so re-publishing from the same dir reuses the existing remote.

## Native tools for the rest

- **`bash`** — find by pattern (`find`, `rg --files`), search by content (`rg`), git operations, ad-hoc shell.
- **`read`** — read a file, optionally windowed.
- **`edit`**, **`write`** — modify files. Use `is_write` when the result is a Note (frontmatter, capture); use native `write` for source code, config, plain `README.md`.

## Patterns

- **Navigate before writing.** Use `bash` (`find` / `rg --files`) and `read` the target area first.
- **Search before creating.** Use `bash` (`rg`) to check if something similar exists.
- **Entities connect.** Add `attached_to` when writing a Note: `hostname:acme.com`, `person:alice`.
