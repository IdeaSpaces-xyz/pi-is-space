# Writing Standard for IdeaSpaces

**The full standard lives in the [writing reference](../../reference/writing.md)** — generated from the canonical SDK skill catalog. Read it when writing or revising a Note: it covers summaries, sections as the semantic fingerprint, concreteness, progressive disclosure, and what not to do. The notes below are only the surface-specific bits.

## Frontmatter this surface writes

Required on create:
- `name` — human-readable title
- `summary` — the most important field. Dense, two sentences; it's what awareness and search surfaces show.

Optional but valuable:
- `tags` — descriptors for search, not categories ("regulatory", "series-a")
- `attached_to` — bind the entity a Note is about: `hostname:acme.com`, `person:alice`, `note:n_abc123`. Entities you name in the prose should be entities in the index — that's how Notes connect across the Space.

## Placement

Always inspect the target area first (`bash` with `find` / `rg --files`, then `read`). Understand what branches mean (their READMEs). Place content where it compounds with related knowledge; reuse existing locations before creating new ones.

This standard applies whenever **is-capture** proposes writing to the space.
